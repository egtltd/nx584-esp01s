Connect nx584 to control panel Caddx NetworX

The NetworX control panels have the ability to automatically find and store in memory the presence of all keypads,
zone expanders, wireless receivers, output modules, and any other device on the keypad buss.
This allows these devices to be supervised by the control panel.  
To enroll the nx584, enter the Program Mode using the procedure outlined in the control panel Installation Manual.
When the Program Mode is exited, the NX-8 control will automatically enroll the devices.
The enrolling process takes about 12 seconds, during which time the Service LED will illuminate.
User codes will not be accepted during the enrolling process.
